weave-python Readme
===================

This is a standalone client for the Weave server API implemented in Python.

It supports most of the User API and the read portions of the Sync API,
and has full support for decrypting encrypted browser object data.  Encryption
is not currently implemented.

It depends on the M2Crypto module, which is currently hosted at:
